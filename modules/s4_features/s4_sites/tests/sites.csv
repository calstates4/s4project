"Martin Luther King Jr. School","1713 Broadway Avenue","","Seaside","CA",93955,"Martin Luther King Jr. Academy is a public school serving grades 3,4,5,6,7 and 8 within the Seaside community.   The Under the Big Top After School Program is designed to serve the physical, emotional, intellectual and social needs of young adolescents.
  
Students at this stage of life demonstrate a significant diversity in rates of growth and maturity.  Most students between the ages of 11 and 14 are undergoing the following changes - social maturation, growth in independence, growth in importance of peer relationships, intellectual maturation, and development of norms and values.

These physical, intellectual, emotional and social changes do not always occur easily or smoothly.  Early adolescence has traditionally been a time of difficulty.  For this reason, it has been suggested that students in this age range be educated in an environment that addresses and eases the transition from childhood to full adolescence.  The goal of the Under the Big Top After School Program is to provide a safe and nurturing environment where students are active learners in academic and enrichment opportunity classes.    

Program Schedule:
3:30-4:25  Academic Support Class
4:25-4:45  Snack (provided by program)
4:45-5:45  Enrichment Club
5:45-6:00  Bus pick-up and student departure  

How our program works:
Each student is enrolled in an Academic Support class for the first hour of the program from 3:30-4:25.  Tutors help students finish their homework and check for comprehension and accuracy.  Students who are finished with homework have the opportunity to work on one of our hands on activities focusing on Math, Science, Language Arts and Social Studies concepts & skills.  This gives students a chance to apply what they have learned during the school day. 
 
Enrichment Clubs are held during the second hour of the program from 4:45-5:45.  Each month, students are able to enroll in the Enrichment Club of their choice.  We offer 4-5 different Clubs per month-long \"Session\".  Examples of Clubs we have offered are: Drama, Art, Cooking, Computers, Sports, Gardening, Science, Oceanography, Singing, Dancing, Music, Girls Club, Newspaper writing, Film making, Student Leadership Committee and much, much more!  Enrichment Clubs are a reward for students and an opportunity for them to learn life skills and develop personal interests.  

Our goal is to make learning fun and relevant to the lives of our students.  We do this by turning academic concepts into hands-on activities.  With the decrease in the variety of elective classes offered during the school day, our program tries to fill in those gaps and balance academics with enrichment opportunities.

Shelter Outreach Plus is Monterey County’s leader in ending the cycle of homelessness and domestic violence by providing safe housing, compassionate support, and opportunities for self-sufficiency through outreach, emergency shelter, transitional housing, and supportive services.

Shelter Outreach Plus plays a significant role in Monterey County’s Continuum of Care for the homeless and victims of domestic violence through its programs of outreach, emergency shelter, and transitional housing. For 30 years, our agency has shown remarkable success in helping people move forward with their lives in a positive and safe manner.

Our agency serves men, women and children through several distinct programs. Last year, we served 1,785 adults, 296 children and made 7,483 referrals through the Family Helpline.

We collaborate with several local agencies to provide comprehensive services to homeless individuals and families as well as families dealing with domestic violence. We work with local organizations, coalitions, leaders, and volunteers to educate and inform the general public and help shape policies affecting victims of domestic violence and those experiencing homelessness.

Shelter Outreach Plus’ programs provide a single-point of entry for people in crisis into a total continuum of care where education, recovery, and employment are viewed as key steps to a safe and self-sufficient life. It is through Shelter Outreach Plus that individuals and families can find safe haven and resolve and begin their rehabilitative process in order to transform their life of homelessness into a life of peace and independence.",8313843388,"http://www.shelteroutreachplus.org/","shltradm@salinas.net "

PSI has more than 30 years experience in designing and operating reproductive health, HIV/AIDS prevention, and other health-related social marketing programs in more than 60 nations around the world.  

PSI's Central Coast project was started in 1999 to promote responsible sexual behavior among teens.  Youth leadership is integral to all aspects of PSI's programming from strategic planning to program design and implementation.

The Central Coast project is predominantly focused on rural communities in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, where there is a demonstrated need for increased access to information and resources about sexuality:  
*Half of high school age teens are sexually active.
*Less than half of sexually active teens report using contraceptives every time they have sex.
*Watsonville and Salinas have some of highest teen pregnancy rates in the country.
*Teens are the fastest growing number of new HIV cases.
*One in four teens will contract a sexually transmitted disease during adolescence.

PSI promotes responsible sexual behavior through a multi-faceted approach combining community mobilization, teen-produced media, and skills building for youth and parents. Successes of the Central Coast project include:
ShoutOut, a highly acclaimed quarterly teen newspaper.
Amor y Deseo at Heartville High, an award winning 12-part teen radio novella. 
Habla Conmigo, parent workshops on how to talk with kids about sex.  
Teen Advocates, a group of teen leaders who advocate for increased information and access to contraceptives.

<p>CAN is a U.S.-based non-profit organization that was founded in 2001 in response to the global coffee crisis, which plunged an estimated 20 million families into dire poverty. The founders initiated CAN after visiting several Latin American farming communities facing similar challenges.</p>
<p>Our objective is to link the grassroots struggles and efforts of these communities in a network of rural farmers and consumers that work together to support self-sufficiency and sustainable farming practices. 
CAN's vision is to work with rural communities to develop the capacity to become economically and environmentally sustainable through agriculture and social empowerment.</p>
<p>Our mission is committed to:
Action research - farm-based research that engages investigators and farmers in collaborative efforts to improve local sustainable farming practices
Education; community education, technical assistance, leadership development, consumer education, internships, and ongoing exchanges and communication between the member communities
Marketing;&nbsp; adding value to the rural processes of production and developing producer controlled markets that support local communities and create direct links with consumers.</p>
<p>CAN has developed a \"fair trade direct\" coffee marketing system, which directly links coffee co-ops in Central America with U.S. consumers. By cutting out the middlemen and acting as a nonprofit intermediary, CAN helps farmers receive a just and sustainable price for their coffee. CAN connects growers and consumers in a \"global village farmers market\", which brings together economic viability and ecological farming practices, including transitioning to organic production and reforestation.</p>",8314593619,"canunite.org",""

Services are held four times a year on designated days. The gardens and a small museum is open to the public. Further restoration is being conducted as funds become available. The continued restoration and maintenance of Soledad Mission is made possible by donations of those who cherish California's rich heritage.

Since its inception, El Pajaro CDC has focused on developing micro-enterprises and small businesses. The organization has successfully assisted hundreds of small businesses with technical assistance, loans, business plans, marketing, management, business technology applications and accounting/bookkeeping.  One of El Pajaro CDC's hallmark projects is Plaza Vigil, which was built in 1996, and is one of the few retail business incubators in the U. S. and perhaps the only one serving Latinos. Plaza Vigil has always been a vibrant community resource located in the heart of Watsonville's downtown.   El Pajaro CDC acts as the micro-enterprise development partner for Childcare Ventures, a child care outreach, education and business development project providing assistance to Latino, monolingual family childcare providers. El Pajaro CDC has also fostered the creation of the Watsonville Childcare Providers Association with membership of 55 women that manage their own businesses at home. During the FY06/07 El Pajaro CDC served 588 clients, from those 67% percent were women and 95% percent were Hispanic. Some of El Pajaro CDC's major accomplishments for FY06/07 include the following: 
El Pajaro CDC was able to exceed its goals in terms of number of hours and number of current and prospective businesses that received services. This was possible thanks to the establishment of partnerships that allowed El Pajaro CDC to leverage new funds and resources. 

El Pajaro CDC was able to exceed its goals in terms of number of hours and number of current and prospective businesses that received services. This was possible thanks to the establishment of partnerships that allowed El Pajaro CDC to leverage new funds and resources. 

One-on-one technical assistance. With assistance from the Appleton grant and other funds, El Pajaro CDC provided over 1369 hours of bilingual technical assistance to Watsonville and Pajaro Valley residents, including assistance to 14 Plaza Vigil Business Incubator Merchants and the Plaza Vigil Merchants association, Small Farmers, Family Childcare Providers and Cal Works Clients. This included clients that attended training and one-on one counseling sessions.

Training. - A total of 123 hours of training were provided to 288 current and prospective business owners in the Watsonville and Pajaro Valley area. Trainings provided by El Pajaro CDC included Business Plan Training workshops for new entrepreneurs, small farmer and the Plaza Vigil's Incubator tenants.

Micro-lending: Thanks to the funds granted by the Appleton Foundation our organization was able to renew The Community Partnership Loan Program with the Santa Cruz Community Credit Union and increase the total amount of the Revolving Loan fund. El Pajaro CDC initially had $11K in available for lending. During the past year, the loan fund was increased to $50K. El Pajaro CDC used the $14K granted by the Appleton Foundation for this purpose and additional $25K that El Pajaro CDC deposited from el Pajaro CDC's reserve. This decision made by El Pajaro CDC's shows the commitment that this organization has to its organizational mission of 'Promoting equal access to economic opportunity.' In addition to this, The Santa Cruz Community Credit Union is matching the fund 2:1. Therefore, the total amount available for loan is $100K. El Pajaro CDC considers this a tremendous success and continues seeking funds to increase the loan fund.

<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">Members of IOC faith communities have responded to community needs more effectively as a group, making Joining Hands to Make a Difference an integral part of who we are. Early examples included: supporting the Food Bank for Monterey County, All Saints&rsquo; and Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Food Pantries and the Rice Plus Project that provides 2,600-3,000 pounds of rice and beans in family-sized packages monthly, loading Nancy Costello&rsquo;s truck as she distributes food to migrant agricultural workers, donating blankets to Shelter Outreach Plus, and facilitating donations of women&rsquo;s clothing to the Women Alive! shelter in Salinas run by Dorothy's Place. This last activity has now become a recurring activity of the Friends, other IOC members and the Yellow Brick Road, providing pajamas, underwear and warm clothing for homeless women.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">For 2008, the IOC planned a showcase of health and human services nonprofit agencies to inform the public, school and health care providers, as well as other groups involved in social justice issues, about the wealth of free or low-cost services available in our county. As the IOC planned this fair, we ran into another organization, Monterey Peninsula&rsquo;s Community of Caring, which was planning a similar event on the same day. As a result, the IOC co-sponsored the event, eventually called the We Care Fair, at Del Monte Center in Monterey. The Community of Caring was working with Pacific Grove and Marina High Schools, with their focus being on finding volunteer opportunities for youth. The focus of the combined fair was on volunteering, with health and human services organizations also represented. The goal of the fair was to foster a community in which service is valued, encouraged and pursued.</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">In 2008, the IOC co-sponsored a Hunger Symposium hosted by St. Philip&rsquo;s Lutheran Church. The featured speakers were former Congressman Leon Panetta and David Gist from Bread for the World.</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">As a part of the IOC monthly general meetings, speakers are sometimes invited to brief members on their activities and needs. Speakers in the past have included a representative of the Agriculture and Land-Based Training Association (ALBA). This organization works with farm workers to train them to be organic farmers and start their own businesses. Farmers bring their produce to churches or schools for sale. Another speaker from Shelters in a Storm spoke about preparing for emergencies and how local neighborhoods and faith communities can assist in this regard.</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">In 2009, the IOC arranged venues in participating faith communities for the Compassionate Care Alliance in partnership with Hospice Advance Health Care Planning Workshops. &nbsp;We have also provided venues for community forums conducted to pursue the idea of a new Monterey Bay Village program, designed to keep seniors living in their homes longer.</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">Members of the IOC celebrate together during such occasions as the 2009 Community Thanksgiving Eve Interfaith service held at the Unitarian Universalist Church of the Monterey Peninsula.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">In the planning stages for 2010 is a faith explorations series designed to increase our understanding of the tenets of each other&rsquo;s faith.</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">Also being planned in 2010 is a benefit shop that will enable us to provide more than helping hands, which are not always sufficient to deal with life-sustaining issues that stem from financial realities. An IOC benefit shop could directly address the IOC mission by tapping into the initial premise of the IOC: that we can do things collectively that we are unable to do individually.</p>
