The Mini-Corps students would use their talent and dedication to work in migrant impacted classrooms, and would be the link between the migrant community and the schools. They would be personally acquainted with each child and their family- they could share their hopes and frustrations. Most important, they would be role models that hopefully would raise the aspiration of migrant children.

<p>CAN is a U.S.-based non-profit organization that was founded in 2001 in response to the global coffee crisis, which plunged an estimated 20 million families into dire poverty. The founders initiated CAN after visiting several Latin American farming communities facing similar challenges.</p>
<p>Our objective is to link the grassroots struggles and efforts of these communities in a network of rural farmers and consumers that work together to support self-sufficiency and sustainable farming practices. 
CAN's vision is to work with rural communities to develop the capacity to become economically and environmentally sustainable through agriculture and social empowerment.</p>
<p>Our mission is committed to:
Action research - farm-based research that engages investigators and farmers in collaborative efforts to improve local sustainable farming practices
Education; community education, technical assistance, leadership development, consumer education, internships, and ongoing exchanges and communication between the member communities
Marketing;&nbsp; adding value to the rural processes of production and developing producer controlled markets that support local communities and create direct links with consumers.</p>
<p>CAN has developed a \"fair trade direct\" coffee marketing system, which directly links coffee co-ops in Central America with U.S. consumers. By cutting out the middlemen and acting as a nonprofit intermediary, CAN helps farmers receive a just and sustainable price for their coffee. CAN connects growers and consumers in a \"global village farmers market\", which brings together economic viability and ecological farming practices, including transitioning to organic production and reforestation.</p>","","","http://canunite.org","Youth Development|Immigration |Global|Environment|Education|Community/Economic Development|Agriculture","Non-Profit"

As a result, the IOC co-sponsored the event, eventually called the We Care Fair, at Del Monte Center in Monterey. The Community of Caring was working with Pacific Grove and Marina High Schools, with their focus being on finding volunteer opportunities for youth. The focus of the combined fair was on volunteering, with health and human services organizations also represented. The goal of the fair was to foster a community in which service is valued, encouraged and pursued.</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">In 2008, the IOC co-sponsored a Hunger Symposium hosted by St. Philip&rsquo;s Lutheran Church. The featured speakers were former Congressman Leon Panetta and David Gist from Bread for the World.</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">As a part of the IOC monthly general meetings, speakers are sometimes invited to brief members on their activities and needs. Speakers in the past have included a representative of the Agriculture and Land-Based Training Association (ALBA). This organization works with farm workers to train them to be organic farmers and start their own businesses. Farmers bring their produce to churches or schools for sale. Another speaker from Shelters in a Storm spoke about preparing for emergencies and how local neighborhoods and faith communities can assist in this regard.</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">In 2009, the IOC arranged venues in participating faith communities for the Compassionate Care Alliance in partnership with Hospice Advance Health Care Planning Workshops. &nbsp;We have also provided venues for community forums conducted to pursue the idea of a new Monterey Bay Village program, designed to keep seniors living in their homes longer.</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">Members of the IOC celebrate together during such occasions as the 2009 Community Thanksgiving Eve Interfaith service held at the Unitarian Universalist Church of the Monterey Peninsula.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">In the planning stages for 2010 is a faith explorations series designed to increase our understanding of the tenets of each other&rsquo;s faith.</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">Also being planned in 2010 is a benefit shop that will enable us to provide more than helping hands, which are not always sufficient to deal with life-sustaining issues that stem from financial realities. An IOC benefit shop could directly address the IOC mission by tapping into the initial premise of the IOC: that we can do things collectively that we are unable to do individually.</p>

to improve health outcomes for children, youth and families, the City of
Salinas joined together with the Violent Injury Prevention Coalition (VIPC) and
their foundation Partners for Peace, to launch a community collaborative
planning process. The resulting framework, Cultivating Peace in Salinas focuses
primarily on reducing youth violence but also addresses overall community well
being. The intent of the framework is to provide a snapshot of community assets
and needs, and to chart out the kinds of long-term efforts needed to prevent
and reduce violence.</span></p>","","","http://partner4peace.org","Violence Prevention|Public Safety|Education|Community/Economic Development","Non-Profit"

These Peer Mentors then provide educational workshops to local high school students and fellow CSUMB students. The POSTPONE Teen Pregnancy Collaborative unites the efforts of our diverse populations to achieve healthy and responsible sexual attitudes through education and values, resulting in having an informed and respectable community. This promotes positive behavior changes at the individual, family and community levels, leading to prevention of teen pregnancy.
 
Our program targets two critical areas: pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease prevention and healthy decision making.

","","We have a great need to establish information databases, currently for volunteers countywide. We can work with students to achieve specific goals, and create projects to fit both of our needs.
ESTABLISMENT OF VOLUNTEER DATABASE:
Unification of all volunteers in to one stream lined database for employee use, and outside volunteer registration. 
Easy to use database that holds all volunteers personal information regarding volunteer history, volunteer preferences, and interests for proper program placement.
Access to database from our website, for Board Members and outside project Managers.
Easy sorting, mailing lists and other information for us to use.

Here, what others see as problems, Chartwell sees as opportunities.  Our immediate goal is to guide children toward becoming healthy, curious, confident and appreciated learners again.

Many gain even more.  After an average of three years at Chartwell, students return to mainstream education as capable learners.  More than 75% of our students return to public schools.

These results are much higher than would ever have been predicted for this type of learner without successful intervention at Chartwell. 

  The roles of illiteracy and learning failure in juvenile crime, teen pregnancy, high school dropouts, childhood anxiety and depression, substance abuse, long-term welfare dependence, and adult incarceration are well documented.

<h4 class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\">Since December 2005, the Women Alive Program is committed
to women living on the streets. We provide an emergency overnight shelter and
hospitality center, where homeless women can have dinner, take showers, do
laundry, take a deep breath from the life in the streets and spend the night in
a safe, non-judgmental and nurturing space. This is the only no-questions-asked
emergency walk-in shelter for street women in Monterey County. <br /> <br /> The Women Alive! Program is located in Dorothy's Place Hospitality Center, in
the Dayroom area. Every day, our Dayroom closes at 2:00 p.m. for cleaning and
transformation into the Women Alive! Shelter. Homeless women may enter from
7:00-8:30 every night and stay until 6:30 in the morning. </span></h4>
<h4 class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong></strong><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\">Following the Franciscan tradition of unconditional
love and peace, this emergency shelter not only seeks to provide a safe roof to
homeless women but also to validate their human and loving capacity to engage
in constructive attitudes.<span>&nbsp; </span>We aim
to offer them some stabilization based on companionship and gentleness.</span></h4>
<h4 class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\">The women who come to this shelter have many
opportunities to share meals, safe sleeping space and engage in conversations
that support their dreams and efforts to move forward with their lives!&nbsp;
We can say that the real gift of the shelter<span>&nbsp; </span>is the daily re-discovery of life and opportunities.</span></h4>
<h4 class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\">We understand that being homeless is first a
reality of aloneness and soul hunger.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore, it&rsquo;s a blessing to witness distraught women receive the
chance for a safe deep breath; how a smile slowly come to their faces, along
with the slow dawning realization that they are no longer alone. </span></h4>
<h4 class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\">Because of that, we provide homeless women with a
space where they can cultivate nurturing feelings and sense of well-being.&nbsp;
We constantly seek for new and better ways to communicate, to deeply listen and
help them to face daily challenges, including supplanting demoralizations due
to their impaired conditions. <span>&nbsp;</span>Opening
our doors for women at night constantly amaze us. We have discovered that being
&lsquo;an instrument of peace&rsquo; not only feels really good but it&rsquo;s constructive and
self-developing! </span></h4>
<h4 class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\">How You Can Help! </span></strong></h4>
<h4 class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\">You can help keeping the Women Alive! shelter open
every night. We are blessed to get resources from individual donors and responsible
citizens from the Salinas community as well as from grants from United Way

"El Pajaro Community Development Corporation",1,"23E Beach St #209","","Watsonville","CA",95076,"El Pajaro Community Development Corporation was formed in 1978 with the mission of ¿Promoting equal access to economic opportunity. Since its inception, El Pajaro CDC has focused on developing micro-enterprises and small businesses. The organization has successfully assisted hundreds of small businesses with technical assistance, loans, business plans, marketing, management, business technology applications and accounting/bookkeeping.  One of El Pajaro CDC¿s hallmark projects is Plaza Vigil, which was built in 1996, and is one of the few retail business incubators in the U. S. and perhaps the only one serving Latinos. Plaza Vigil has always been a vibrant community resource located in the heart of Watsonville¿s downtown.   El Pajaro CDC acts as the micro-enterprise development partner for Childcare Ventures, a child care outreach, education and business development project providing assistance to Latino, monolingual family childcare providers. El Pajaro CDC has also fostered the creation of the Watsonville Childcare Providers Association with membership of 55 women that manage their own businesses at home. During the FY06/07 El Pajaro CDC served 588 clients, from those 67% percent were women and 95% percent were Hispanic. Some of El Pajaro CDC¿s major accomplishments for FY06/07 include the following: 
El Pajaro CDC was able to exceed its goals in terms of number of hours and number of current and prospective businesses that received services. This was possible thanks to the establishment of partnerships that allowed El Pajaro CDC to leverage new funds and resources. 

El Pajaro CDC was able to exceed its goals in terms of number of hours and number of current and prospective businesses that received services. This was possible thanks to the establishment of partnerships that allowed El Pajaro CDC to leverage new funds and resources. 

One-on-one technical assistance. With assistance from the Appleton grant and other funds, El Pajaro CDC provided over 1369 hours of bilingual technical assistance to Watsonville and Pajaro Valley residents, including assistance to 14 Plaza Vigil Business Incubator Merchants and the Plaza Vigil Merchants association, Small Farmers, Family Childcare Providers and Cal Works Clients. This included clients that attended training and one-on one counseling sessions.

Training. - A total of 123 hours of training were provided to 288 current and prospective business owners in the Watsonville and Pajaro Valley area. Trainings provided by El Pajaro CDC included Business Plan Training workshops for new entrepreneurs, small farmer and the Plaza Vigil¿s Incubator tenants.

Micro-lending: Thanks to the funds granted by the Appleton Foundation our organization was able to renew The Community Partnership Loan Program with the Santa Cruz Community Credit Union and increase the total amount of the Revolving Loan fund. El Pajaro CDC initially had $11K in available for lending. During the past year, the loan fund was increased to $50K. El Pajaro CDC used the $14K granted by the Appleton Foundation for this purpose and additional $25K that El Pajaro CDC deposited from el Pajaro CDC¿s reserve. This decision made by El Pajaro CDC¿s shows the commitment that this organization has to its organizational mission of ¿Promoting equal access to economic opportunity.¿ In addition to this, The Santa Cruz Community Credit Union is matching the fund 2:1. Therefore, the total amount available for loan is $100K. El Pajaro CDC considers this a tremendous success and continues seeking funds to increase the loan fund.

1) The All-Star Program fills an important gap in public education for providing standards-based live performing arts experiences to county youth. The program meets several goals, including, but not limited to the following: 1) Enhances cross cultural communication for our youth; 2) Exposes under served youth to live performing arts; 3) Builds audience diversity; and 4)Strengthens collaborations in the arts community.
A capstone project should/could consider the importance of live performing arts education to youth, particularly to those in under served communities, in preventing increased gang association, violence and drop-outs. Moreover, research indicates that there's an inequity in the availability of arts to students with wealthier, higher performing schools receiving the resources for arts education, while lower performing schools are denied it. A student project could investigate the differences in our school districts county-wide, track the patterns of violence in our community, and provide valuable information to educators and administrators alike. 
Another suggested option would be to measure the impact of the performing arts experience on the participants. The evaluative study could measure changes in attitudes and cultural perceptions, reading comprehension, self confidence, leadership skills, and appreciation of the literature and the ability of the students to apply it to other disciplines.
2)Graphic Design and Marketing: A capstone project could investigate the value of marketing for a small non-profit. It would consider multiple approaches to successful brand identity and tailored marketing to diverse audiences. The research could/would identify a need for a diversified approach, identify new audiences and develop key messages, create new avenues for effective and affordable advertising, and provide a cost/benefit analysis of marketing for small non-profit organizations. Finally, the special project would measure the success of the promotion in terms of increased visibility for the organization, ticket and box office sales, increased membership and individual donations, and greater awareness of the Forest Theater Guild and its legacy in the community.
3)F.T. Renner Student Short Film Festival: A Capstone project would be in project management. This intern will be taking the concept and implementing the expanded program from beginning to end. This would include initial research into the various film schools, finding sponsors, selecting the films, working with local screen writers and directors, promoting the event, working with selected vendors, and coordinating the event.
In addition to working with the executive director, the interns will also be mentored by Dr. Barbara Mossberg, a professor who teaches service learning and Hamish Tyler, Administrator for the Arts of Monterey County Office of Education and High School teacher with 32 years of teaching experience.</p>","http://www.foresttheaterguild.org","Youth Development|Violence Prevention|Technology|Media|Literacy|Immigration |Environment|Education|Arts","Non-Profit"

Central coast living provides a richness which when added to the Girl Scout program creates options only limited by the girls themselves in choosing and designing activities that follow their interests and dreams. From fitness in rock climbing, soccer and surfing to art and mural design, girls are presented with a multitude of options. Plus, by tapping into scientific and marine biology resources and the mosaic of cultures, food and music to be found in the local region, girls acquire understanding and growth in knowledge.

Just as the geography of the three counties is diverse, so are its communities and residents. Since its inception, Girl Scouts of the Monterey Bay has taken responsibility to be a community resource, leading as well as collaborating to create outreach programs in migrant camps and other non-traditional settings, and tackling such contemporary issues as teen parenthood, drugs and alcohol.

"LUPE Central Coast - La Union del Pueblo Entero",0,"1330 E. Alisal St.","","Salinas","CA",93905,"LUPE, La Union del Pueblo Entero, is a non-profit organization that seeks to improve the quality of life for farm worker, Latino and immigrant communities throughout rural California.

In 1989, honored civil rights and labor leader Cï¿½sar E. Chï¿½vez founded La Uniï¿½n del Pueblo Entero to focus on the needs and problems that Latino immigrants and farm workers encounter daily, such as overwhelming poverty rates, indecent housing and living conditions, and unjust access to health care.  Cï¿½sar realized that workers had needs beyond the work place.  Although Cï¿½sar founded a labor union through the United Farm Workers (UFW), these other needs could best be addressed through the creation of organizations such as LUPE to address the indignities specifically beyond the workplace.  LUPE is not a labor union and is a separate and distinct 501(c)(3) organization.  

Today, LUPE has operations in three states that include California, Texas and Arizona.  Nationally, LUPEï¿½s programs demonstrate a track record of effective leadership development.  LUPE provides an array of services from its offices in a three-state regions.  These services include:

ï‚§	Leadership development and community organizing programs
ï‚§	U.S. Citizenship classes
ï‚§	Literacy programs
ï‚§	English as a Second Language (ESL) programs	
ï‚§	General Equivalency Diploma (GED) courses
ï‚§	Income tax preparation and assistance
ï‚§	Immigration forms preparation
ï‚§	Notary Services
ï‚§	Discounts & benefits to LUPE members

LUPE has developed experience with community service and outreach over the last 16 years.  LUPE in California has utilized their experiences over those years and the experience of the Farm Worker Movement.  The strength of LUPE is found within our leaders, volunteers and staff that build the organization through house meeting after house meeting, committee after committee, campaign after campaign.  LUPE committees respond to the injustices facing farm worker and immigrant communities. Most of our focus during this time has been on specific needs in farm worker communities as they emerge.","","-Youth Coffee House Project","http://www.lupenet.org","Youth Development|Women's Issues|Technology|Social Services|Nutrition/Fitness|Literacy|Immigration |Housing & Homelessness|Health & Human Services|Environment|Education|Community/Economic Development|Before/After School|Agriculture|Advocacy","Non-Profit"

<p>We are a fairly small school with approximately 400 students in grades K-5.  Our students come from diverse cultural backgrounds and often speak English as their second language.  We celebrate this diversity. You will find our school has a very welcoming feel to it.  The staff is friendly and the students are generally very polite and respectful.  We encourage people to volunteer who are conscientious, caring, and enjoy being around children.</p>","","<p>Open</p>","http://www.mpusd.k12.ca.us/marinavistaelementaryschool/home","Education","Elementary School"

<p>Martin Luther King Jr. Academy is a public school serving grades 3,4,5,6,7 and 8 within the Seaside community.   The Under the Big Top After School Program is designed to serve the physical, emotional, intellectual and social needs of young adolescents.
  
Students at this stage of life demonstrate a significant diversity in rates of growth and maturity.  Most students between the ages of 11 and 14 are undergoing the following changes - social maturation, growth in independence, growth in importance of peer relationships, intellectual maturation, and development of norms and values.
These physical, intellectual, emotional and social changes do not always occur easily or smoothly.  Early adolescence has traditionally been a time of difficulty.  For this reason, it has been suggested that students in this age range be educated in an environment that addresses and eases the transition from childhood to full adolescence.  The goal of the Under the Big Top After School Program is to provide a safe and nurturing environment where students are active learners in academic and enrichment opportunity classes.    
Program Schedule:
3:30-4:25  Academic Support Class
4:25-4:45  Snack (provided by program)
4:45-5:45  Enrichment Club
5:45-6:00  Bus pick-up and student departure  
How our program works:
Each student is enrolled in an Academic Support class for the first hour of the program from 3:30-4:25.  Tutors help students finish their homework and check for comprehension and accuracy.  Students who are finished with homework have the opportunity to work on one of our hands on activities focusing on Math, Science, Language Arts and Social Studies concepts & skills.  This gives students a chance to apply what they have learned during the school day. 
 
Enrichment Clubs are held during the second hour of the program from 4:45-5:45.  Each month, students are able to enroll in the Enrichment Club of their choice.  We offer 4-5 different Clubs per month-long \"Session\".  Examples of Clubs we have offered are: Drama, Art, Cooking, Computers, Sports, Gardening, Science, Oceanography, Singing, Dancing, Music, Girls Club, Newspaper writing, Film making, Student Leadership Committee and much, much more!  Enrichment Clubs are a reward for students and an opportunity for them to learn life skills and develop personal interests.  
Our goal is to make learning fun and relevant to the lives of our students.  We do this by turning academic concepts into hands-on activities.  With the decrease in the variety of elective classes offered during the school day, our program tries to fill in those gaps and balance academics with enrichment opportunities.</p>","","<p>There are so many opportunities for capstone projects at our site!  We are open to all of your ideas.  Specific needs and ideas will be posted periodically.</p>","http://www.mpusd.k12.ca.us/programs.html","Youth Development|Violence Prevention|Technology|Social Services|Public Safety|Literacy|Environment|Education|Before/After School|Arts|Advocacy","Middle School|Elementary School"

Our Mission:

The Cebrowski Institute for Innovation and Information Superiority sponsors cross-discipline projects leading to innovations that strengthen global security in the information age. 

Who we are: 

The Cebrowski Institute helps in a world dominated by distributed communication networks. Founded in 2002 as one of three inaugural institutes at the Naval Postgraduate School, the Institute operates as a network of research centers and projects serving a broad community of students and faculty. Our concentrations:


-Hastily Formed Networks (HFN) 
-Network Centric Operations (NCO) 
-Worldwide Consortium for the Grid (W2COG) 
-Autonomous Coordination 
-Mobile Devices and Communications 
-Information Operations 
-Counterterrorism and Irregular Warfare 
-Information Assurance and Security","","We are hosting a Rebooting Computing Summit on Jan. 12th-14th, 2009. This is an invitational summit of 200 visionary leaders from all sectors touched by computing, including science, engineering, industry, business, education, journalism, policy-making, and government. We will create projects and form teams that will seed, nurture, and cultivate new ideas in the community. We will cross international borders. We will aggressively publicize the message of the wonder of computer science and the hope for the future. 
This is not a paper-presentation or inspiring-orations summit. This is a get-it-done summit. We will roll up our sleeves and work for three days to bring each of our most creative ideas forward and let them loose to innovate in our community. We are not trying to achieve a consensus around any one idea: we want to unleash many ideas. Using the Appreciative Inquiry process, professional facilitators will guide us to this outcome.
We are looking for several students from CSUMB that could attend the 3-day event to video-tape and take pictures throughout the summit. We would ask that they provide the equipment and upload the photos and video to our website each evening.  We would provide food and accomodations for the students.

"Population Services International",1,"406 Main St, Suite 423","","Watsonville","CA",95076,"PSI is an international nonprofit organization with local offices in Watsonville.  PSI provides information, services and products aimed to reduce the rates of unintended teen pregnancy and to promote HIV/AIDS awareness in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties.

PSI has more than 30 years experience in designing and operating reproductive health, HIV/AIDS prevention, and other health-related social marketing programs in more than 60 nations around the world.  

PSI¿s Central Coast project was started in 1999 to promote responsible sexual behavior among teens.  Youth leadership is integral to all aspects of PSI¿s programming from strategic planning to program design and implementation.

The Central Coast project is predominantly focused on rural communities in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, where there is a demonstrated need for increased access to information and resources about sexuality:  
·Half of high school age teens are sexually active.
·Less than half of sexually active teens report using contraceptives every time they have sex.
·Watsonville and Salinas have some of highest teen pregnancy rates in the country.
·Teens are the fastest growing number of new HIV cases.
·One in four teens will contract a sexually transmitted disease during adolescence.

PSI promotes responsible sexual behavior through a multi-faceted approach combining community mobilization, teen-produced media, and skills building for youth and parents. Successes of the Central Coast project include:
·ShoutOut, a highly acclaimed quarterly teen newspaper.
·Amor y Deseo at Heartville High, an award winning 12-part teen radio novella. 
·Habla Conmigo, parent workshops on how to talk with kids about sex.  
·Teen Advocates, a group of teen leaders who advocate for increased information and access to contraceptives.

","","PSI would like to develop a website for ShoutOut.  The website design will be fairly complex, with search engines, moving imagery, monthly online quizes, question and answer sections, etc.  PSI is looking to fill one of the following internships (depending on capability and time commitment of intern):

Website Advisor: Intern would review the proposals submitted from multiple web designers, meet with PSI staff and program partners and develop a strategy/plan for web site development and implementation.

Website Coordinator: Intern would work with PSI staff, teens and web designers to create a web site for ShoutOut.

While PSI staff is extremely eager to create a website for ShoutOut, we also realize that it will demand a lot from an intern.  The challenges are that the proposed website is very complex.  Serving as either an advisor or coordiantor for the web site will require immersing oneself in a lot of information and options without extensive guidance from PSI staff.  We need someone who is motivated, self-directed and very techinical, yet able to understand the objectives of our teen program.","http://www.psi.org (PSI's international web site)","Health & Human Services|Media|Youth Development","Non-Profit"

Shelter Outreach Plus is Monterey Countyâ€™s leader in ending the cycle of homelessness and domestic violence by providing safe housing, compassionate support, and opportunities for self-sufficiency through outreach, emergency shelter, transitional housing, and supportive services.

Shelter Outreach Plus plays a significant role in Monterey Countyâ€™s Continuum of Care for the homeless and victims of domestic violence through its programs of outreach, emergency shelter, and transitional housing. For 30 years, our agency has shown remarkable success in helping people move forward with their lives in a positive and safe manner.

Our agency serves men, women and children through several distinct programs. Last year, we served 1,785 adults, 296 children and made 7,483 referrals through the Family Helpline.

We collaborate with several local agencies to provide comprehensive services to homeless individuals and families as well as families dealing with domestic violence. We work with local organizations, coalitions, leaders, and volunteers to educate and inform the general public and help shape policies affecting victims of domestic violence and those experiencing homelessness.

Shelter Outreach Plusâ€™ programs provide a single-point of entry for people in crisis into a total continuum of care where education, recovery, and employment are viewed as key steps to a safe and self-sufficient life. It is through Shelter Outreach Plus that individuals and families can find safe haven and resolve and begin their rehabilitative process in order to transform their life of homelessness into a life of peace and independence.","","","http://www.shelteroutreachplus.org/","Women's Issues|Substance Abuse|Social Services|Housing & Homelessness|Education","Non-Profit"

The Natural Sciences After School Program was developed in partnership with the Monterey Bay Charter School in Pacific Grove, CA and the Recruitment in Science Education program in Salinas and Marina.  This science-based after school program is open to children throughout the Monterey area.  Half of our After School program is dedicated to working specifically with underserved, at-risk youth.  Current participants come to us from the Recruitment in Science Education program and the Martin Luther King Jr. Academy in Salinas.

Students are transported to a local wilderness area and introduced to an environment that many of them have never been exposed to or even aware of, despite such close proximity to their homes.  Students are encouraged to observe and journal changes in this site from visit to visit, and to become aware of how they are interconnected with the environment.   

A basic step in protecting the environment and it's resources is the education of our youth, and one of the most important goals we can achieve is to provide opportunities for local youth - especially those who are at-risk or disadvantaged.

"AFTA Associates - Art For The Animals",0,"Mission Patio Shops - Mission between 5th & 6th","","Carmel","CA",93921,"AFTA Associates is a non-profit conservation organization that works in collaboration with existing wildlife and nature conservancy organizations to make consumers aware of endangered species and environmental and sustainability issues; raise money for their wildlife research, education and training programs; and to make the business of conservation, a business from which local communities can make a living.
","","AFTA¿s flagship program is Art For The Animals¿, a unique education and development program that uses hand crafted folk artas thank you gifts for donors who contribute to participating wildlife organizations.  The art is crafted by local artisans who share the land or the region with the animals, and who are part of a conservation enterprise or economic self-sufficiency program, or an indigenous group trying to preserve its culture.  Art For The Animals: educates consumers and raises awareness of endangered species, environmental and sustainable development issues;  
raises funds for wildlife and nature conservancy;
creates a unique, self-fulfilling, culturally sensitive and potentially broad market for indigenous art and conservation enterprise products by offering specific pieces as donor premiums; changes consumer behavior ¿ turning excess holiday consumerism into conservationism and support for ecologically sustainable economic systems.

AFTA markets the program through its catalog, website and recently established Carmel shop.
