The typical student enters Chartwell with academic performance two or more years below expected grade level, despite normal or better intelligence.  Here, what others see as problems, Chartwell sees as opportunities.  Our immediate goal is to guide children toward becoming healthy, curious, confident and appreciated learners again. ",100,"Test results from 1999-present reveal that students gain more than one full year in key basic skills in reading, writing, vocabulary, comprehension, and math for each year they are at Chartwell.  Many gain even more.  After an average of three years at Chartwell, students return to mainstream education as capable learners.  More than 75% of our students return to public schools. Chartwell estimates that more than 90% complete high school and 70% go on to college or other post-secondary learning.  These results are much higher than would ever have been predicted for this type of learner without successful intervention at Chartwell. 

  The roles of illiteracy and learning failure in juvenile crime, teen pregnancy, high school dropouts, childhood anxiety and depression, substance abuse, long-term welfare dependence, and adult incarceration are well documented.  Chartwell is determined to make a difference in these statistics. Chartwell  alumni often tell us, 'You changed my life.'

Shelter Outreach Plus is Monterey County’s leader in ending the cycle of homelessness and domestic violence by providing safe housing, compassionate support, and opportunities for self-sufficiency through outreach, emergency shelter, transitional housing, and supportive services.

Shelter Outreach Plus plays a significant role in Monterey County’s Continuum of Care for the homeless and victims of domestic violence through its programs of outreach, emergency shelter, and transitional housing. For 30 years, our agency has shown remarkable success in helping people move forward with their lives in a positive and safe manner.

Our agency serves men, women and children through several distinct programs. Last year, we served 1,785 adults, 296 children and made 7,483 referrals through the Family Helpline.

We collaborate with several local agencies to provide comprehensive services to homeless individuals and families as well as families dealing with domestic violence. We work with local organizations, coalitions, leaders, and volunteers to educate and inform the general public and help shape policies affecting victims of domestic violence and those experiencing homelessness.

Shelter Outreach Plus’ programs provide a single-point of entry for people in crisis into a total continuum of care where education, recovery, and employment are viewed as key steps to a safe and self-sufficient life. It is through Shelter Outreach Plus that individuals and families can find safe haven and resolve and begin their rehabilitative process in order to transform their life of homelessness into a life of peace and independence.","","","http://www.shelteroutreachplus.org/","Women's Issues|Substance Abuse|Social Services|Housing & Homelessness|Education","Non-Profit","Service Learning"

Beginning as an all day summer program, it has now expanded to include:
	A safe place for young people to explore and discover their potential.  CPY staff endeavors to look at the \"whole child.\"
	A set of Standards based on integrity and respect, to develop values and character.
	Afterschool tutoring and enrichment program in four locations.
	All day Intersessions (8:30 a.m. ' 4:30 p.m.) during school breaks.
	Middle school leadership, job and life skills training.
	High school leadership, job experience and life skills training.
	Enrichment programs that include a Visual and Performing Arts Academy, service learning projects, sports and recreation.
	Special emphasis on learning and literacy.
	Reading lab andor volunteer reading program. 
	Computer lab at several sites.
	Work experience for young people, parents and grandparents.

CPY provides consistent support in a safe environment for young people to develop boundaries and learn to build on their individual strengths.
    ","","We need to do a longitutinal study on the children since 1991.   Where are they?   What are they doing?   Have they stayed out of the system?   Did they go on to college?

How can children learn when they have learning disabilities?    What techniques can be incorporated to assist in their learning?

We believe if you have a talent or need our program can meet it!   Our children and families are very diverse and their needs are many.  We encourage you to sit down and converse with us.

How can we fill in the gap for students who are not on a college track but with the proper direction could be eligible for college.

The population of Castroville is also young, with about half of the residents under 21.

Near Castroville there is a park with a nature preserve that is home to some rare and endangered plants. Environmentally oriented students could be involved in work to preserve native plants and control invasive species.

The school year programs evolved from the Mini-Corps Summer Program. The idea for a corps of people from rural migrant background to work not only in the summer school, but also in the regular school year was born, and put into action in 1974. The Mini-Corps students would use their talent and dedication to work in migrant impacted classrooms, and would be the link between the migrant community and the schools. They would be personally acquainted with each child and their family- they could share their hopes and frustrations. Most important, they would be role models that hopefully would raise the aspiration of migrant children. Through the summer and school year programs the Mini-Corps students provide services to the migrant children of California.   Objectives: Provide direct categorical services to Migrant Children, which match or exceed performance standards prescribed in the California Master Plan.  Increase the numbers of professionals who are sensitive and committed to the needs of migrant children.     ","","","","Education","Non-Profit|Elementary School","Service Learning"

PSI provides information, services and products aimed to reduce the rates of unintended teen pregnancy and to promote HIVAIDS awareness in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties.

PSI has more than 30 years experience in designing and operating reproductive health, HIVAIDS prevention, and other health-related social marketing programs in more than 60 nations around the world.  

PSI's Central Coast project was started in 1999 to promote responsible sexual behavior among teens.  Youth leadership is integral to all aspects of PSI's programming from strategic planning to program design and implementation.

The Central Coast project is predominantly focused on rural communities in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, where there is a demonstrated need for increased access to information and resources about sexuality:  
Half of high school age teens are sexually active.
Less than half of sexually active teens report using contraceptives every time they have sex.
Watsonville and Salinas have some of highest teen pregnancy rates in the country.
Teens are the fastest growing number of new HIV cases.
One in four teens will contract a sexually transmitted disease during adolescence.

PSI promotes responsible sexual behavior through a multi-faceted approach combining community mobilization, teen-produced media, and skills building for youth and parents. Successes of the Central Coast project include:
ShoutOut, a highly acclaimed quarterly teen newspaper.
Amor y Deseo at Heartville High, an award winning 12-part teen radio novella. 
Habla Conmigo, parent workshops on how to talk with kids about sex.  
Teen Advocates, a group of teen leaders who advocate for increased information and access to contraceptives.

","","PSI would like to develop a website for ShoutOut.  The website design will be fairly complex, with search engines, moving imagery, monthly online quizes, question and answer sections, etc.  PSI is looking to fill one of the following internships (depending on capability and time commitment of intern):

Website Advisor: Intern would review the proposals submitted from multiple web designers, meet with PSI staff and program partners and develop a strategyplan for web site development and implementation.

Website Coordinator: Intern would work with PSI staff, teens and web designers to create a web site for ShoutOut.

While PSI staff is extremely eager to create a website for ShoutOut, we also realize that it will demand a lot from an intern.  The challenges are that the proposed website is very complex.  Serving as either an advisor or coordiantor for the web site will require immersing oneself in a lot of information and options without extensive guidance from PSI staff.  We need someone who is motivated, self-directed and very techinical, yet able to understand the objectives of our teen program.","http://www.psi.org (PSI's international web site)","Health & Human Services|Media|Youth Development","Non-Profit","Service Learning"
