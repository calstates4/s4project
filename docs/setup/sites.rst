Sites

Sites are a general term given to a location where a student can sign up. Some programs call them "community partners," or other terms, but they are essentially all the same thing: an organization that the university has a relationship with, and where students can sign up to do something with.

Approval
--------

All sites have an approval process, which is customizable to your university's needs, and which can have multiple steps and defined roles of who is allowed to move a site along in the approval process. When a site is initially created, it's in a "Draft" state, and that draft can be continually edited without making it available to the public or to students. Using a draft is a great way to start getting information about a possible site partnership into the system as soon as possible. When your site is finally published, and made visible to students and the public, you can always start a new draft to begin the process all over again.

Let's look at an example of how a site's approval process might work:

1. A non-profit, Anthill Farms, calls your service learning program and asks if students could do service learning with them. After a quick vetting, a department staff creates a new site by clicking the **Sites** tab, then the **Add new site** button. She clicks the **Save as draft** button so noone can see the Anthill Farms sites, since she doesn't have all the information.
2. The department staff asks for the executive director to email her basic information like a description. She edits the site and keeps it in draft a few days later when she gets this information.
3. Meanwhile, the Risk Management office does a site visit and attaches the checklist to the site as a **Site Form** (see :ref:`site-forms`). They change the site's status to **Approved by Risk Management**.
4. The service learning department finally gets all their information in, and is ready to make the site available. They change the status to **Published** and the site is availble to be signed up with.
5. Two weeks later, the service learning staff realize they forgot to enter the website as part of the site's information. They edit the site and publish it immediately, since there wasn't a substantive change to the site and it doesn't need approval.
6. A year later, Anthill Farms changes their mission and starts wanting students to build actual Ant Farms. A new draft is created for the site, but this time it's status is **Needs Risk Management Approval** and the process begins again. During this time, the draft that's pending approval may be edited multiple times. 

Approving sites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When anyone views a site that's pending approval, they will always see a yellow box on the top of the site. Depending on their level of access (for example, Risk Managers might be able to change their approval, but not actually publish a site or create a new one), they will either see just the current approval status, or a form to change the status, and a place to leve a note about the site.

Viewing approval history
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The **Approval** tab, which is visible when you are on a site's page, shows all the current and previous draft versions of the site, along with who changed the approval of a site and when, along with any notes they left. On this screen, the current, public version of the site is green, and any drafts which are awaiting approval are red.

While there are usually only up to two versions of a site available at a time, the **Published** version and a new **Draft** version, you can also view any previous drafts from this screen, and even revert the site back to a prior version.

Site staff is a general term given to anyone who works at or for a given site. These can be general contacts to keep track of, like a non-profit's Education Coordinator, or people who can accept students as their coordinator, like a needle-exchange program's volunteer coordinator.
