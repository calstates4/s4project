Sites
=====

Sites are a general term given to a location where a student can sign up. Some programs call them "community partners," or other terms, but they are essentially all the same thing: an organization that the university has a relationship with, and where students can sign up to do something with.

.. _approval:
Approval
--------

All sites have an approval process, which is customizable to your university's needs, and which can have multiple steps and defined roles of who is allowed to move a site along in the approval process. When a site is initially created, it's in a "Draft" state, and that draft can be continually edited without making it available to the public or to students. Using a draft is a great way to start getting information about a possible site partnership into the system as soon as possible. When your site is finally published, and made visible to students and the public, you can always start a new draft to begin the process all over again.

Let's look at an example of how a site's approval process might work:

1. A non-profit, Anthill Farms, calls your service learning program and asks if students could do service learning with them. After a quick vetting, a department staff creates a new site by clicking the **Sites** tab, then the **Add new site** button. She clicks the **Save as draft** button so noone can see the Anthill Farms sites, since she doesn't have all the information.
2. The department staff asks for the executive director to email her basic information like a description. She edits the site and keeps it in draft a few days later when she gets this information.
3. Meanwhile, the Risk Management office does a site visit and attaches the checklist to the site as a **Site Form** (see :ref:`site-forms`). They change the site's status to **Approved by Risk Management**.
4. The service learning department finally gets all their information in, and is ready to make the site available. They change the status to **Published** and the site is availble to be signed up with.
5. Two weeks later, the service learning staff realize they forgot to enter the website as part of the site's information. They edit the site and publish it immediately, since there wasn't a substantive change to the site and it doesn't need approval.
6. A year later, Anthill Farms changes their mission and starts wanting students to build actual Ant Farms. A new draft is created for the site, but this time it's status is **Needs Risk Management Approval** and the process begins again. During this time, the draft that's pending approval may be edited multiple times. 

Approving sites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When anyone views a site that's pending approval, they will always see a yellow box on the top of the site. Depending on their level of access (for example, Risk Managers might be able to change their approval, but not actually publish a site or create a new one), they will either see just the current approval status, or a form to change the status, and a place to leve a note about the site.

Viewing approval history
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The **Approval** tab, which is visible when you are on a site's page, shows all the current and previous draft versions of the site, along with who changed the approval of a site and when, along with any notes they left. On this screen, the current, public version of the site is green, and any drafts which are awaiting approval are red.

While there are usually only up to two versions of a site available at a time, the **Published** version and a new **Draft** version, you can also view any previous drafts from this screen, and even revert the site back to a prior version.

.. _site-forms:
Site Forms
----------
Every campus and department has numerous types of forms they need to fill out. These could be risk management forms, agency agreements, or site visit checklists. To manage any site's forms, click the "Forms" tab when viewing a site. This means all the forms you collect from a site can be found in a single location, and we can do some whizbang things like give you an overview of the status of all your sites and whether they have a form about to expire, and email you when a form that requires refreshing every few years.

Uploading a paper form
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To start, we can upload a simple form. These might be a PDF you have filled out with a site, or a scan of a paper form. To add this form to a site, click the **Forms** tab under the site, and click the **Add new form** button. You have the following options:

1. **File name** - The name of your file.
2. **File description or notes** - A quick note about the file you are uploading
3. **File category** - The type of file you are uploading (see :ref:`file-categories`)
4. **Tags** - A quick way to categorize this file, for example "Needs review"
5. **Expiration date** - When this file will expire, if ever.
6. **Enable expiration reminder** - When checked, an email will go out to anyone who is subscribed to S4's expiration notifications when this file will expire.
7. **Reminder date** - The date when this reminder should be sent out.
8. **Files** - The actual scanned or digital copy of the form. 

If you want to be notified when a form is about to expire, click the **Email me when a form expires** button under the **Forms** tab.

Adding online forms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also fill out an online form (see :ref:`online-forms`) about a site yourself, by seleing the appropriate form from the **Attach a form.** Once you fill out the form, it will be attached to the site. If you need someone else to fill out the form, click the **Email form to someone else** link and either select the site staff who needs to fill the form out, or type in an email address. You should also provide a subject and message so the person knows what this email is about. At the end of your message, the link to fill ou thte form will be added.

.. _notes:
Notes
-----

Notes are useful way to track your communications and site visits, or leave any other notes for others about the site. To view or create new notes, click the **Notes** tab when viewing a site. You can add a note by clicking the **Add new note** button, and have the following options:

1. **Title** - The title of your note
2. **Contact type** - A phone call? A site visit?
3. **Contact tags** - Tag this note to help categorize it later.
4. **Files** - If you have any scanned notes you want to upload, you can add a file to a note (although you might want to add it as a form if this is a form).

Site staff

Site staff is a general term given to anyone who works at or for a given site. These can be general contacts to keep track of, like a non-profit's Education Coordinator, or people who can accept students as their coordinator, like a needle-exchange program's volunteer coordinator.
