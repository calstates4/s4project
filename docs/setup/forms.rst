Forms
=====

There are several kinds of forms in S4, but the biggest two that your end-users will see are either **online forms** or **downloadable forms**. Online forms are forms you... complete online! They are used in several places throughout S4 for students to complete site evaluations, faculty to fill out assessments of student learning, and even sites to provide additional information to your department. Regardless of who fills out these forms, or when they do it, they are all built and managed the same way. Downloadable forms are just a quick way to store forms that your students or faculty need to download and fill out, which are useful for things that require signatures like an hours report.

To access all the forms on your site, just click the **Forms** tab. Here you will see both the online and downloadable forms you already have available, along with buttons to create new forms.

Downloadable forms
==================

Downloadable forms are just uploaded versions of paper forms. To create a new downloadable form, click the **Forms** tab, then the **Add downloadable form** button. editing an existing form just requires clicking the **Edit** link next to its name. These are the following options for creating or editing downloadable forms:

1. **Form name** - The name of your form.
2. **File description** - A short description of what the form should be used for.
3. **Available to** - Select the programs that require this form. You can choose multiple options (see :ref:chosen_).
4. **Show on signup** - When checked, this form will be displayed when a student signs up for service, and also be sent in the email confirmation to students.
5. **File** - The actual file users need to download, we suggest using PDFs.
