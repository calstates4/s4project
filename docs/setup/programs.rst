Things to think about
=====================

S4 was built to be extremely flexible, and with an eye to allowing multiple departments to exist within one website, which helps community partners (they don't get five different calls from departments about risk management forms), and helps ensure that partner information is accurate. In short, by having multiple departments all maintaining the same list of sites, students, programs, and signups, the more eyes the better.

You can, of course, give multiple departments their own S4 to use; however, that causes duplication of work from IT staff (they have to integrate two systems with the campus SIS, for example) and means that students might have an inconsistent experience when they are part of multiple programs. Below are a list of things to think about before you start your S4 journey. You might want to consult the :ref:`glossary` before reading this.

--------
Programs
--------

Programs in S4 are ways to divide up sites, courses, and students, and to let S4 know who's allowed to edit a site. Sites and site staff can be restricted to specific programs, and students are granted access to a program and it's associated sites and site staff by either being a part of a program directly (like a teacher ed program) or by being registered for a course associated with a program (like a Service Learning course):

For example, a high school (the site) may also have an after-school program. While a few teachers are available to mentor under for the teacher education department, there are also coordinators of the after-school program who can accept service learners. Some of these coordinators are also teachers and can mentor student teachers. If the site itself is setup to accept both service learners and teacher education students, each site staff can be restricted to just service learning, just teacher ed, or both (there are more options for site staff, see :ref:`site-staff`).
