S4 is built on top of an open-source platform called `Drupal <http://drupal.org>`_, which means you can add additional functionality to your site if needed, and also means that some of the documentation on how to do things can be found on Drupal's website, rather than in the S4 documentation. The following guides are helpful for your technical administrator:

* **`Installing themes and modules <http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes>`_** - While you should probably not install a different theme for S4, you can sometimes install additional modules that will not conflict with S4 to add authentication, additional types of fields, or custom CAPTCHA options. This guide will help you actually install these modules.
