Information security
====================

S4 is built with security and flexible-yet-simple role-based permission system in mind so that department staff can get their jobs done, and IT professionals can sleep well at night.

Role-based security
===================

Like all of Drupal sites (see :ref:`drupal`), S4 has a role-based security model. This means that for each "role," i.e. a "staff" user, has different levels of permissions. Users can have multiple roles, and each role adds new permissions to the user with that role. In short, S4 follows an *additive permission* model, where each role you add to a user adds more permissions.
