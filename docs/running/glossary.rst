* *Site* - This can be kind of confusing, as S4 itself is a website (and we try to refer to it as such throughout the documentation), but "sites" in S4 are a short-hand for what some campuses might call a "community partner." Sites are basically places where a student can go as part of a program.
.. _tokens:
* *Tokens* - Tokens are ways to inject content into a text area, usually an email. The most common example is for the confirmation email sent to students in a program. This email might read "Dear [first name], you have signed up for [site name]," those bracketed words are called tokens, and anywhere tokens are supported you will see a list of all available tokens below the text area. Clicking on a token's name will insert it right where your cursor is.
