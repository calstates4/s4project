Demonstration Module
===============================

If you go to ``admin/modules`` and enable the **S4 Demonstration** module, you will find demo courses, users, and site information within your installation. When you go to ``admin/structure/feeds`` there are numerous example feeds to copy.

The Demo module also includes sample data that is automatically imported into your site. This can be useful for training without exposing FERPA data, or to just play around with S4. `View the sample data included with the demo module <https://github.com/kevee/csu_student_signup/tree/master/modules/s4_features/s4_core/modules/s4_demo/data>`_.
