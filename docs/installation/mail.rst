=======================

S4 can send a lot of mail, especially when reminding students about placements or emailing large groups of site staff in the community. If you are reaching the thousands of emails a month threshold, you might want to consider using a service like `Mandrill <http://mandrill.com/>`_, which improve the email sending process and can deliver reports on emails sent and emails read. Below is a list of modules you can install to improve email flow:

1. **`Mandrill <http://mandrill.com>`_** - A bulk transactional email system from Mail Chimp. `Drupal module <http://drupal.org/project/mandrill>`_.
2. **`Amazon simple email service <http://aws.amazon.com/ses/>`_** - Large transaction email gateway, use with the `SMTP Authentication module <http://drupal.org/project/smtp>`_.
