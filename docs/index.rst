S4: Students Signup for Service and Stuff
=========================================

Students need to sign up for lots of things besides courses. Things like service learning, teacher education, or social work programs all need to track students outside the scope of a course or even a semester. The Signup Project will provide a way for a campus to track the relationships between community partners, site coordinators, students, faculty, courses, and programs; while being simple to maintain and easy (even fun!) to use.

This project is a collaboration between the CSUMB Web Services department and the Center for Community Engagement

We're tracking the project at the Project Site: http://s4.csumb.edu/project
