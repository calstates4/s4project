S4: Supporting Students & Service Sites
=======================================

S4 is a free software solution that allows your campus to track service-learning, internships, and undergraduate research experiences, as well as as teacher education and social work placements. S4 is uniquely designed to easily manage the CSU's risk management processes and provides students, faculty and community members with a user-friendly interface to manage CSU students' outside learning experiences.

This project is a collaboration between the CSUMB Web Services department and the Center for Community Engagement
