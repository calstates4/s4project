Students need to sign up for lots of things besides courses. Things like service learning, teacher education, or social work programs all need to track students outside the scope of a course or even a semester. The Signup Project will provide a way for a campus to track the relationships between community partners, site coordinators, students, faculty, courses, and programs; while being simple to maintain and easy (even fun!) to use.

This project is a collaboration between the CSUMB Web Services department and the Center for Community Engagement

INSTALLATION
You should ensure that you have a system supported by Drupal version 7. Learn more about these minimum install requirements here:
http://drupal.org/requirements

In addition, you should increase your web server PHP memory limit to at least 80M.

If you are checking out from GIT, this is not a complete site, it requires using Drush to build the make file. If you have downloaded the packaged version of the app, just put it in your app server, and visit mysite.edu/install.php and make sure to select the S4 install profile on the first screen.

We're tracking the project at the Project Site: http://s4.csumb.edu/project
